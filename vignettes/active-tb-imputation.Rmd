This vignette steps through how we estimate the unobserved active TB progression.

## Previous studies

There are few references for active TB progression data.
We use the observed incidence in the Lancet (xxxx) paper (taken directly from the plots and the tail probabilities from Sutherland (xxxx).

The counts in the Lancet paper are

```{r}
data("incidence_Lancet", package = "LTBIscreeningproject")

plot(incidence_Lancet$mean, type = 's', ylim = c(0,300), xlab = "Year", ylab = "Incidence")
lines(incidence_Lancet$lower95, type = 's', lty = 2)
lines(incidence_Lancet$upper95, type = 's', lty = 2)
```

We rescale these counts to proportions.
We also fit an exponential distibution to the tail of the Lancet data.

All of the data can be put together.
